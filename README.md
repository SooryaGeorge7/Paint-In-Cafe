## Design

### Color Scheme
*[Initial Paint-In cafe color palette](documentation/paint-in-caf%C3%A9-color-palette.png)

I initially inserted the color palette above thinking that the colors appear the same(atleast almost) on all devices.After finishing the website and checking my website on other devices i realised that my colors looked very different from my own laptop. 
I thought the color **#67D387** was a pastel mint green color but it appeared bright green on other devices.The **#7B9F82** was supposed to be a grey color which turned out to be a shade of green on other devices. I decided to change these two colors to accomodate my device and other devices. I tested the color **#C4C3C7** and **#ADD0B3** below and they looked more like the colors i wanted in all the other devices.
I used pastel green color because i find green to be a calming color and i found that a lot of art websites used **pastel** colors. I thought the dark red(**#8C2323**) gives a good contrast to the pastel green and it may also be reminscent of the cafe interior and dark furniture. The white and grey helps with the flow and balance of the two contrast colors.I decided againt using the **#F0996A** because the color ddnt flow nicely with the design and i ddnt know how to incorporate without it clashing with the other colors.

**Final Color Palette**
![Inserting changed color palette](documentation/final-color-palette.png)

### Typography

I used these two Google Fonts for headings and other texts because they pair well together.
I used [Typ.io](https://typ.io/) to help with pairing.
* [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)-This is a transitional serif typeface and i used this for headings.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)-This is a humanist sans serif typeface and i used this for paragraphs and other texts.

### Imagery
All images in the website were taken from a free image source called Pexels.I have included the links to the images in [Credits](#credits) section.
* [Pexels website](https://www.pexels.com/)-Used for all images and videos in website.
* [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/105795/paintbrush-and-palette)-Used for the logo and favicon.
* [TinyPNG](https://www.tinypng.com/)-Used to compress images.
* [Birme](https://www.birme.net/)-Used to change formating to increase accessibility.

### Wireframes
Wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop view
* **HOME PAGE**![Home page wireframe](documentation/home-wireframe.png)
* **ABOUT PAGE** ![About page wireframe](documentation/about-wireframe.png)
* **CAFE PAGE** ![Cafe page wireframe](documentation/cafe-wireframe.png)
* **GALLERY PAGE** ![Gallery page wireframe](documentation/gallery-wireframe.png)
* **EVENTS ENQUIRY PAGE**![Event enquiry page wireframe](documentation/event-enquiry-wireframe.png)



* The final designs look very different to initial wireframe designs because i started thinking more and more about user experience and design flow and realized i had to change a lot.I have also added a Thank you page for after user submits form.

### Future Implementation

* I really wanted to make a slideshow of pictures in the home page and events page but learnt that i would need to use javascript inroder to do so.
* I would implement making the gallery images in gallery page clickable and to appear full size when clicked on.
* I would use javascript for my fixed images in my website to work properly on IOS devices. See more in [Known Bugs](#known-bugs)

If this website was based on a real cafe:-
* I'd want to implement google reviews in the website so that website visitors would be able to understand the experience from the customer's point of view.
* Change the gallery page outlay to display previous customer's artwork, returning customers will be able to go check out their paintings in the gallery.
* Implement a share button inorder for site visitors to share the website with others. 
* I would have liked to include a video of the cafe's concept to help the user understand better.
* I would also include an art class page for customers who actually want to sign up for evening art classes.
* It would also be intersting to have best artwork of the month awards section in the home page.

---

### Accessibility

These are the ways i have ensured to provide accessibility to users:
* Used HTML semantics.
* Provided navigation links to access other pages.
* Used rem and % for font sizes and image sizes throughout website because it can scale up or down according to user's device.
* Highlighted the navigation link to the current page you are on.
* Ensured Colour Contrast so that the websites are easily readable in light and dark mode.
* Provided alt for images incase images do not load.
* Provided information for icons where no text was provided.
* Provided a submit button in the contact form which will then direct you to a thank you page with navigation links still displayed so that you can navigate around the website more if needed. 
* Aria labels were implemented for links and videos.[Learnt you can use aria-labels for videos here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Alt_Technologies)
* Google font "Playfair display" was chosen carefully and i chose the pairing to this font "Open Sans" here [Playfair display pairing](https://typ.io/fonts/playfair_display#:~:text=Playfair%20Display%20is%20a%20serif,Work%20Sans%2C%20Circular%20and%20Georgia.).

## Testing

I used chrome developer tools extensively while developing the project.

Once my project was submitted for peer-code-review, the following issues were raised to me: 
1) When clicking on the logo, the website took you directly to the footer instead of home page.-This was done on purpose initially because i wanted the user to have the details in the footer as easily accessible as possible but my mentor confirmed to changing the href of logo to the home page(index.html) too.
2) When clicking form submit button, the submit button allowed a pop up messaging without validating any of the inputs given by user.-The form method was changed to "GET" and action to "thankyou.html which led you to thank you page once you are able to submit and changing input type and adding required attribute.The "onclick" javascript function was removed from the code as the pop alert message will be shown even with invalid inputs.

### W3C Validator

I used W3C validator website to validate HTML and CSS of my website. The image links of each page is listed down below:

* [Home page html validation](documentation/home-page-w3c.png)
* [About page html validation](documentation/about-page-w3c.png)
* [Cafe page html validation](documentation/cafe-page-w3c.png)
* [Gallery page html validation](documentation/gallery-page-w3c.png)
* [Events page html validation](documentation/event-page-w3c.png)
* [Thank you page html validation](documentation/thankyou-page-w3c.png)
* [Style.css CSS](documentation/css-jigsaw-validation.png)

### Lighthouse

I used lighthouse testing that is within chrome developer tools for testing the cafe's performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO(Search Engine Optimisation)

#### Home page

Link to Initial testing on desktop and mobile:
* [Home page initial lighthouse testing](documentation/home-page-initial-lighthouse.png)

Opportunities/suggestions:
* Consider adding `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins.
* Back ground and foreground don’t have enough sufficient contrast ratio.-Lighthouse suggested changing color of cafe updates div background color.

Final Lighthouse score of Home page:
* Desktop(Light & Dark mode)-

![Home page final lighthouse score for desktop(light and dark mode)](documentation/homepage-desktop-final-lighthouse.png)
* Mobile(Light & Dark mode)-

![Home page final lighthouse score for mobile(light and dark mode)](documentation/homepage-mobile-final-lighthouse.png)

 #### About page

 Link to initial testing on desktop and mobile:
 * [About page initial lighthouse testing](documentation/aboutpage-initial-lighthouse.png)

 Opportunities/suggestions:
 * Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio.Image display dimensions should match natural aspect ratio.- I changed the height and width attributes of about page image to ensure correct aspect ratio of image in all screens.



 Final lighthouse score of About page:
 * Desktop(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![About page final lighthouse score for desktop(light and dark mode)](documentation/aboutpage-desktop-final.png)
 * Mobile(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![About page final lighthouse score for mobile(light and dark mode)](documentation/aboutpage-mobile-final.png)

 #### Cafe page

 Link to initial testing on desktop and mobile:
 * [Cafe page initial lighthouse testing](documentation/cafepage-initial-lighthouse.png)

 Opportunities/suggestions:
 * Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order- My cafe menu divs's headings were h3 and the page heading was h1, i added another h2 between the two heading to compensate.


 Final lighthouse score of Cafe page:
 * Desktop(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![Cafe page final lighthouse score for desktop(light and dark mode)](documentation/cafe-desktop-final.png)
 * Mobile(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![Cafe page final lighthouse score for mobile(light and dark mode)](documentation/Cafe-mobile-final.png)

 #### Gallery page

 Link to initial testing on desktop and mobile:
 * [Gallery page initial lighthouse testing](documentation/gallery-initial-lighthouse.png)

 Opportunities/suggestions:
 * Links do not have a discernible name- I added aria-label to scroll button a tag in gallery.html
 * Image display dimensions should match natural aspect ratio- The images stretched  when displayed in bigger devices and i added object-fit attribute with value cover to fix this issue.


 Final lighthouse score of Gallery page:
 * Desktop(Light & Dark mode)- 
 
 ![Gallery page final lighthouse score for desktop(light and dark mode)](documentation/galler-desktop-final.png)
 * Mobile(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![Gallery page final lighthouse score for mobile(light and dark mode)](documentation/gallery-mobile-lighthouse.png)

 #### Event Enquiry page

 Link to initial testing on desktop and mobile:
 * [Event Enquiry page initial lighthouse testing](documentation/eventpage-initial-lighthouse.png)

 Opportunities/suggestions:
 * Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time- I compressed the images in the website using tiny.png and changed format of images to WebP format.

 Final lighthouse score of Event Enquiry page:
 * Desktop(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![Event enquiry page final lighthouse score for desktop(light and dark mode)](documentation/events-desktop-final.png)
 * Mobile(Light & Dark mode)-
 
 ![Event enquiry page final lighthouse score for mobile(light and dark mode)](documentation/events-mobile-final.png)

 #### Thank You Page

 I tested the thank you page once and had really great results, and did not have any suggestions.

7. If you look at the main home page, there is a background video with text overlying it with a button that says **"learn more"** which can be clicked on to be directed to the main section of home page.
8. The main section of home page has a 6 boxes or divs, 1 box called bookings has an **Events Enquiry** link that can be clicked on to be directed to the event enquiry page directly.This link should work.

Check these links and buttons in the `About` and `Cafe` page.Both pages have a section inbetween the footer and header.The headers also contain a background video and overlying text(heading).
12. The `Gallery` page has the same links as the home page, with the addition of a scrollup button. When clicked, it should direct you back to the top of the page.

### BUGS
#### Known Bugs

* It was brought to my attention that my fixed images(Images with style attribute position with value "fixed") in my home page and cafe page does not work on iphone devices/ IOS devices and safari browsers.I did not have any IOS devices at home and was not aware of it until a friend sent a screenshot to me from her iphone. The images appeared stretched or zoomed in and did not have the effect of a fixed image.My fixed images worked on my laptops, and all the  android devices. I had asked in Slack what could be the reason and was adviced by Grace Mckenna that IOS doesnt support that code and could be outside the scope of project 1. After some intense googling, i had found a solution for future implementation that says you can use javascript for it to work on iphone devices.[Stack overflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20443574/fixed-background-image-with-ios7). At this point in my project , i was almost done with the project  and the readme file too.In the future i will be aware of it and try and see if i can implement javascript to have the desired effect on IOS devices.



#### Solved Bugs

* Making a herovideo that also acts as a background video. I couldnt use the background attribute in css  to add the background videos and make changes in that way. I had to insert video in a div in html and adjust the video using css to make it appear as a background video/gif rather than a video that stands alone.
* I could not fit navigation links in the smaller screens without it looking too cluttered or the font-size being ineligable.I decided to make a hamburger toggler for smaller screen which will show navigation links when clicked on.
* My menu of naviagtion links in smaller screens were not displaying properly because all the elements were on the same level, then i used z-index to make my menu higher than the other elements on the screen to make sure menu is displayed ontop of the other elements without the other elements showing through. 
* The background video did not want to center itself as the screensizes increased or decreased- this was fixed by adding a outer div to video and setting the position of div to relative while you position the video itself to absolute. Set the object-fit of video to cover. Set the bottom attribute of video to be 0.
* The images in gallery did not have the correct aspect ratio while doing lighthouse testing- I solved this by adding the css attribute object-fit with value of cover to every image in the gallery.
* The form submit button was allowing pop up message to occur without validating inputs given by user. - Changed the method attribute of form to "GET"and action to "thankyou.html" and removed onclick javascript function from input element.
* It was brought to my attention that background videos do not work on ios devices because autoplay is not supported by IOS devices, so i tried to find answers online and found a solution in stack overflow [Stack Overflow solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59325257/html5-video-background-not-playing-safari-on-iphone).I added playsinline attribute to my video elements and they seemed to help IOS devices to play the background video.I unfortunately do not have an ios device, my friend reassured me that the video worked on her phone after my changes.
