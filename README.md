## Design
### Color Scheme
![Inserting paint-In cafe color palette](documentation/Paint-In%20Caf%C3%A9%20Color%20Palette.png)
I used pastel green color because green is often calming color and it matches with the actual cafe itself. I thought the dark red gives  a good contrast to the pastel green. The white and grey helps with the flow of the two contrast colors.
### Typography
I used these two Google Fonts for headings and other texts because they pair well together.
* Playfair Display-This is a transitional serif typeface and i used this for headings.
* Open Sans-This is a humanist sans serif typeface and i used this for paragraphs and other texts.

### Imagery
All images in the website were taken from a free image source called Pexels.
